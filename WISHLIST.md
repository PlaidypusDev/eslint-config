# Wishlist

- Only have one release please action but set up sections in the release please PR description/changelog to be separated by package
- Fix dependencies by moving dependencies to peer dependencies. There is a [PR open](https://github.com/PlaidypusDev/eslint-config/pull/20) for this but I'm not sure if the dependencies are set up correctly.
